[Microsoft favors Anthropic over OpenAI for Visual Studio Code](https://www.theverge.com/report/778641/microsoft-visual-studio-code-anthropic-claude-4) — *The Verge*  


### Why I Find It Interesting
Microsoft recently added an automatic AI model selector to Visual Studio Code that favors **Claude Sonnet 4** over **GPT-5**, even though Microsoft has a long partnership with OpenAI. Paid GitHub Copilot users will now rely primarily on Claude for coding tasks.  

I think it’s really interesting that Microsoft is choosing Claude Sonnet 4 over GPT-5 for Visual Studio Code, even though Microsoft works so closely with OpenAI. It shows that Microsoft cares more about which model actually works better for coding, instead of just sticking with their main partner’s product. To me, it also means that Anthropic’s AI is now strong enough to compete with—and even outperform—OpenAI’s newest model in some situations.

## Siddhanta's Comment

It’s kind of surprising that Microsoft is starting to favor Anthropic’s Claude Sonnet 4 over OpenAI’s GPT-5 for coding tasks in GitHub Copilot. Since Microsoft has invested so much money into OpenAI, I would have expected them to push OpenAI’s models more. It makes me wonder how much better Claude Sonnet 4 must be at coding for Microsoft to shift their own developers toward it.
